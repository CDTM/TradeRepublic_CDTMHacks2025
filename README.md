For working on the case, we provide some sample data, as well as some websocket APIs.

### Data

You can find the sample data in the `data` directory of this repository.

### APIs

How to connect? (wscat example - you can use any websocket client)
```
% wscat --connect wss://api.traderepublic.com
Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
> connect 30
< connected
```

Every further request is a subscription in the format `sub <incrementing number> <payload>`.  
Responses will come back with the subscription number, starting with an `A` for "Answer" and then contain the JSON response.  
You can also receive updates for a subscription, as long as you do not run `unsub <subscription number>`.

#### Get Instrument Metadata
Instrument metadata are retrieved with a subscription called `instrument`. The `id` in the subscription is an ISIN.
```
sub 1 {"type": "instrument", "id": "DE000BASF111"}
< 1 A {"active":true,"exchangeIds":["LSX","TDG","TIB"],"exchanges":[{"slug":"LSX","active":true,"nameAtExchange":"BASF AG O.N.","symbolAtExchange":"BAS","band":6,"firstSeen":1547548103379,"lastSeen":1746673522056,"firstTradingDay":null,"lastTradingDay":null,"tradingTimes":null,"fractionalTrading":{"minOrderSize":"0.0000010","maxOrderSize":null,"stepSize":"0.0000010","minOrderAmount":"1","maxOrderAmount":null},"settlementRoute":"DEFAULT","weight":null},{"slug":"TDG","active":true,"nameAtExchange":"BASF SE","symbolAtExchange":"BAS","band":null,"firstSeen":1585287001108,"lastSeen":1746682222427,"firstTradingDay":null,"lastTradingDay":null,"tradingTimes":null,"fractionalTrading":null,"settlementRoute":"DEFAULT","weight":null},{"slug":"TIB","active":true,"nameAtExchange":"BASF SE","symbolAtExchange":"DE000BASF111","band":null,"firstSeen":1718096444166,"lastSeen":1746716424091,"firstTradingDay":null,"lastTradingDay":null,"tradingTimes":null,"fractionalTrading":{"minOrderSize":"0.0000010","maxOrderSize":null,"stepSize":"0.0000010","minOrderAmount":null,"maxOrderAmount":null},"settlementRoute":"DEFAULT","weight":null}],"jurisdictions":{"DE":{"active":true,"kidLink":null,"kidRequired":false,"savable":true,"fractionalTradingAllowed":true,"proprietaryTradable":true,"usesWeightsForExchanges":false,"weights":null},"AT":{"active":true,"kidLink":null,"kidRequired":false,"savable":true,"fractionalTradingAllowed":true,"proprietaryTradable":true,"usesWeightsForExchanges":false,"weights":null},[...]},"dividends":[],"splits":[],"cfi":"ESXXXX","name":"BASF AG O.N.","typeId":"stock",[...],"isin":"DE000BASF111","priceFactor":1,"shortName":"BASF","nextGenName":"BASF","alarmsName":"BASF",[...]}
```

#### Get Current Price of an Instrument
For this we have a subscription called `ticker`.  
To retrieve prices for an instrument, you will need the ISIN and the exchange. For the exchange, just use the first entry in the `exchangeIds` list of the `instrument` subscription described above. In this case that would be `LSX`. 
You then form the `id` of the `ticker` subscription by using `<ISIN>.<exchange ID>`.

```
 sub 2 {"type": "ticker", "id": "DE000BASF111.LSX"}
< 2 A {"bid":{"time":1746723164930,"price":"42.85","size":349},"ask":{"time":1746723164930,"price":"42.92","size":349},"last":{"time":1746723164930,"price":"42.85","size":349},"pre":{"time":1746651587908,"price":"42.14","size":0},"open":{"time":1746682200581,"price":"42.24","size":0},"qualityId":"realtime","leverage":null,"delta":null}
< 2 A {"bid":{"time":1746723177773,"price":"42.85","size":585},"ask":{"time":1746723177773,"price":"42.92","size":585},"last":{"time":1746723177773,"price":"42.85","size":585},"pre":{"time":1746651587908,"price":"42.14","size":0},"open":{"time":1746682200581,"price":"42.24","size":0},"qualityId":"realtime","leverage":null,"delta":null}
```

#### Retrieve Historic Prices of an Instrument
For this you use a subscription called `aggregateHistoryLight`. The `id` in the payload is formed the same way as for the `ticker` subscription above.

The following will give you the day end prices of an instrument for up to 5 years.
```
> sub 3 {"type": "aggregateHistoryLight", "id": "DE000BASF111.LSX", "range": "5y", "resolution": 86400000}
< 3 A {"expectedClosingTime":1746738000000,"aggregates":[{"time":1588896000000,"open":"46.24","high":"46.405","low":"45.64","close":"46.25","volume":0,"adjValue":"46.25"},{"time":1589155200000,"open":"46.25","high":"46.49","low":"45.04","close":"45.37","volume":0,"adjValue":"45.37"},{"time":1589241600000,"open":"45.14","high":"45.705","low":"44.73","close":"45.2","volume":0,"adjValue":"45.2"},{"time":1589328000000,"open":"45.2","high":"45.2","low":"42.645","close":"43.045","volume":0,"adjValue":"43.045"},{"time":1589414400000,"open":"42.735","high":"42.915","low":"41.14","close":"42.78","volume":0,"adjValue":"42.78"}, [...]]
```
